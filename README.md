# AI Travel Planner
AI Travel Planner is a modern web application that generates personalized travel itineraries using artificial intelligence. By leveraging Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash API, the application creates detailed day-by-day travel plans tailored to the user's preferences, complete with flight options powered by SerpAPI.

This full-stack JavaScript application features a responsive UI built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS with the shadcn/ui component library. The backend is powered by Express and provides API endpoints for AI-generated itineraries and flight search capabilities.
